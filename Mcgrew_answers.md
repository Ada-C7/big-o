Snippet 1:
Linear, because it is going through each element in the array, and will grow in proportion to the size of the input. It can also stop at anytime in the array and still return a value.

Snippet 2:
Logarithmic, because it's performing a search by customer and returning the corresponding information, such as name and country.

Snippet 3:
Constant, because it's looking for 1 element in the array at a time and no matter how large the array gets, it will still take the same time to complete.

Snippet 4:
Quadratic, because it's a loop within a loop and the loop is in sequence, moving from index1 to index2, and it would go through the array for index1 and then start again for index2, and because both loops are linear, which we'd multiply.

Snippet 5:
Quadratic, because the it's a loop within a loop and both loops are linear.

Snippet 6:
Linear, because we go through each element in the array in order to output the given number.

Snippet 7:
Logarithmic, because it is an insertion sort and insertion sorts are O(n log n).

Snippet 8:
Quadratic, because it is a selection sort and selection sorts are O(n^2).
