1. o(n) Linear - We iterate over every element in the array.
2. o(n) Linear - There are two, un-nested loops here, so we'll add instead of mult.
3. o(1) Constant - Because we're only checkig one element.
4. o(n2) Quadratic - We have two loops here, one nested and we'll have to iterate through both.
5. o(n * m) - There are two linear loops here, independent of each other.
6. o(n) Linear - Once through the array.
7. o(n2) Quadratic - Since we have to loop, then loop again (potentially to the end) to check against each one.
